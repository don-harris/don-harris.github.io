    <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    I haven't done a course like this before. I have zero experience in this area so learning in a way where you have to seek solutions by many different means is both challenging and rewarding.
  </p>

  <p>
    <li>What are your impressions?</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    Exciting, different, progressive
  </p>

  <p>
    <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm very open minded and willing to learn so I think it will be beneficial to all parties hopefully.
  </P>

  <p>
    <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    I guess it's still early days so I'm not really sure. Ask me again in a few weeks !
  </p>

  <p>
    <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
  </p>
  <p>
     I always get nervous but I like to think that makes me thrive. I am excited but just hope I can keep up !
  </p>
