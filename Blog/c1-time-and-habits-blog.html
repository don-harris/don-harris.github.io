    <li>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    It wasn't until after speaking with a fellow cohort member that I tried out the pomodoro technique. It it what I used to create this website.

  <p>
    <li>What did you find interesting?</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    I found that having something in place which allows you to haven time managment almost tricks yourself into being more productive.

  <p>
    <li>What worked for you?</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    Please see above.
  </P>

  <p>
    <li>Which will you experiment further with?</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm going to have to go back and review other techniques. Although I went through them at the time, I didn't apply any in a practical way. Following sprint 1, this is a good opportinity
