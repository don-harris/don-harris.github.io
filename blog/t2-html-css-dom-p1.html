        <p class="questions">Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</p>
        <p>
          Html is all of the inside the human body, the stuff that we need to live and exist. CSS is all the stuff to make you look nice like the outside of your body. Java is like the clothes and the things that do a lot more in a different way. DOM is like if
          we have an x ray or a scan which shows us the but we want to see and inspect.

      <li>
        <p class="questions">What is meant by boxifying design??</p>
        <p>
          Breaking down a webpage into boxes for each section. The header, nav , content etc are in theory, in a box. This allows us to simplify how a webpage might work or its design.

      </li>


      <li>
        <p class="questions">What is the box model?</p>
        <p>
          Every element on a page is a rectangular box and will have width, height, padding, borders and margins.
