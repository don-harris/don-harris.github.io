      <p class="questions">What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</p>
      <p>
        I haven't done a course like this before. I have zero experience in this area so learning in a way where you have to seek solutions by many different means is both challenging and rewarding.
      </p>
    </li>


    <li>
      <p class="questions">What are your impressions?</p>
      <p>
        Exciting, different, progressive.
      </p>
    </li>


    <li>
      <p class="questions">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</p>
      <p>
        I'm very open minded and willing to learn so I think it will be beneficial to all parties hopefully.
      </P>
    </li>



    <li>
      <p class="questions">Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</p>
      <p>
        I guess it's still early days so I'm not really sure. Ask me again in a few weeks !
      </p>
    </li>



    <li>
      <p class="questions">Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>
      <p>
        I always get nervous but I like to think that makes me thrive. I am excited but just hope I can keep up !
